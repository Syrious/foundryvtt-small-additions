# Introduction
This module provides minor QoL additions

## Scrollable sidebar
Having a lot of modules sometimes means having a lot of buttons on the left sidebar. For smaller displays that can be a problem and users might not be able to see every button.
This addition adds a scrolling functionality (without a scrollbar). The sidebar can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel or click and drag.

## Change opacity of hidden drawings
I sometimes can't find some GM notes on the scene because the alpha is too low.
With sit setting you can adjust it to your liking (libWrapper required)
