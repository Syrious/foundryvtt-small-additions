# Introduction
This module provides minor QoL additions

## Scrollable sidebar
Having a lot of modules sometimes means having a lot of buttons on the left sidebar. For smaller displays that can be a problem and users might not be able to see every button.
This addition adds a scrolling functionality (without a scrollbar). The sidebar can now be scrolled with the mouse wheel or click and drag.
